# my_first_blog

This is my first web blog I created using the Django framework.
I've posted this blog on pythonanywhere.com for all to see, and made some silly posts throughout the process.
Functionality includes:
  Security so user has to login, and only that user can make posts and edits
  Posting, editing posts
Some light CSS is included, not bad for a beginner...
